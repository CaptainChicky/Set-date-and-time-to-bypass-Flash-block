# Set-date-and-time-to-bypass-Flash-block
(will polish this up BTW)

Since the latest "security update" of flash on 12/8/2020 introduced the ability for flash to self-block itself after 1/12/2021 based on system time, people who still want to use flash need to set their system before 1/12/2021 to "unblock" it. 

Also note, that the flash installer doesn't work anymore because just like Chrome, it uses the internet to download stuff(it's not a self-extracting archive installer), and just like for older versions of Chrome, Adobe took down their servers for the installer AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
